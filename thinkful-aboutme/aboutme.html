		<h1>Introduction:</h1>
		<p> Starting my Career as a Quality Analyst at SAP LABS helped me to acquire and develop interest in writing test case scenarios and perform web application testing. This interest inturn led me to pursue my masters degree in computer Science and every minute of it was worth the time in learning, experimenting, failing and relearning the same! Determined to take my career ahead as a Frontend developer, I am taking every effort to take the right step to move forward. Have a look at my aboutme page and Hope you enjoy it !</p>

		<h1>More About Me:</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my mini-portfolio website, my name is megha manjunath and most of my friends call me Meg for short and currently staying in California.I was a quality assurance engineer and intend to become a UI/UX developer. One of my dreams is to become a Full-stack Engineer and handle an entire IT process from the beginning to end. </p> 
		<p>I love volunteering for Non profit organizations and help underprivileged children with their education.Infact, I have worked for 2 years as Steward for handling Isha vidhya project in Asha for Education(NGO) and I am always interested to contribute to the society.</p>
		<p>Apart from the hussle and tussle, I love to spend time with friends and family. I spend a lot of time Hiking in the beautiful California trails filled with greenery and shades which gives me an immense satisfaction. Apart from it I love to keep myself physically fit, either taking a leisure walk in the park or hiking the terrains or by having fun with the zumba steps.</p>
